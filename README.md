# ESX Impound - Information

This is a script that I made in the Customer Chat of https://discord.gg/lancegood which I got some good feedback in Direct Messages about. At first, I didn't intend to make this script seriously, but if people from that community thought it was a good script, there might be others out there that also think that.

> The dependencies for this script are: 

- `es_extended`
- `esx_policejob` (or a Police Job in your Database)

# Installation

1) Clone this repository
2) Add alv_impound to your `[esx]` folder
3) Add `start alv_impound` to your server.cfg
4) And you're done!
